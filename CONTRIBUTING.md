# Contributing to FastAPI GQM Quality Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this software quality analysis study!

## üìã Overview

This repository contains an academic study applying the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology to analyze the FastAPI framework. This work is part of the **Software Metrics course (Code: 1322004)** at the **Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF)**, under the **Software Project Management Specialization in the Era of Sensor Data and AI** program, supervised by **Prof. Leonardo Vieira dos Santos Reis**.

While the primary purpose is educational and research-oriented, we welcome contributions that enhance the analysis or methodology.

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### Documentation
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Document any new metrics or analysis approaches
- Provide examples for complex functionality
- Use clear, concise language

### Testing

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description if necessary

Example:
```
Add support for GitHub API data collection

- Implement GitHub API client for issues data
- Add rate limiting and error handling
- Update documentation with API setup instructions
- Add tests for API functionality
```
